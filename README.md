### Installation:

- <strong>To download YouTube videos, your system will need [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed.</strong>
- Clone the repository and navigate to `src\functions` to use the available syncing files (Again, this is a work in progress and a CLI / website version to will be available soon).
